# Bulk Add Production Step Details Implementation

Enables users to efficiently create multiple Production Step Details via cross-product bulk assignment (multi-product Ã— multi-step), with default config, conflict handling, and real-time progress.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Resolve naming conflicts (`CrossProductBulkCreateRequest`, `/multi-assign` endpoint)
- [x] Review and leverage existing codebase patterns for validation, error handling, and auth
- [x] Create generic `MultiSelectList<T>` component (foundation for all multi-selects)
- [x] Implement `ProductMultiSelect` using generic component
- [x] Implement `StepMultiSelect` using generic component
- [x] Build `MultiAssignConfigForm` for default values (sequence, pricing, flags)
- [x] Develop `MultiAssignPreview` (combination summary, conflict warnings)
- [x] Implement `MultiAssignProgress` (progress bar, chunked status, result summary)
- [x] Design and implement `/api/production-step-details/multi-assign` endpoint (with chunked processing, conflict detection, and robust validation)
- [x] Integrate frontend with new API (orchestrate workflow, real-time feedback)

## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Write comprehensive tests (API, components, hooks, integration, edge cases)

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Add CSV import/export for cross-product operations
- [ ] Implement background processing for very large operations
- [ ] Save/load reusable templates for bulk assignments
- [ ] Extend generic multi-select for other bulk features

## Implementation Plan

1. **Foundation**: Build generic multi-select and resolve all naming/API conflicts.
2. **Specialized Components**: Implement product/step selectors and config form.
3. **Integration**: Orchestrate main page, preview, and progress tracking.
4. **API**: Develop robust, chunked backend endpoint with conflict handling.
5. **Testing**: Achieve >90% coverage using existing test patterns.
6. **Polish**: Optimize performance, accessibility, and documentation.
