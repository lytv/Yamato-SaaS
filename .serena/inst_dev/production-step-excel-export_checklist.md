# Production Step Excel Export Feature - Implementation Checklist

## Prerequisites Review
- [ ] Review existing product export implementation in `src/app/api/products/export/route.ts`
- [ ] Study product export hook pattern in `src/hooks/useProductExport.ts`
- [ ] Examine Excel helper functions in `src/utils/excelHelpers.ts`
- [ ] Understand ProductionStep structure in `src/types/productionStep.ts`
- [ ] Review existing validation patterns in `src/libs/validations/productionStep.ts`
- [ ] Analyze ProductionStepList component structure in `src/features/productionStep/ProductionStepList.tsx`

## Step 1: Extend Excel Helper Functions
- [ ] Open `src/utils/excelHelpers.ts` file
- [ ] Add `generateProductionStepsExcel()` function following `generateProductsExcel()` pattern
- [ ] Map ProductionStep fields to Excel columns:
  - [ ] Column A: Step Code (stepCode)
  - [ ] Column B: Step Name (stepName)
  - [ ] Column C: Film Sequence (filmSequence || '')
  - [ ] Column D: Step Group (stepGroup || '')
  - [ ] Column E: Created Date (formatted)
  - [ ] Column F: Updated Date (formatted)
- [ ] Set appropriate column widths (15, 30, 15, 20, 12, 12)
- [ ] Add metadata sheet with production step specific information
- [ ] Add `validateProductionStepExportData()` function
- [ ] Implement validation for required fields (stepCode, stepName)
- [ ] Set maximum export limit to 5000 production steps
- [ ] Test Excel generation with sample ProductionStep data

## Step 2: Extend ProductionStep Validation
- [ ] Open `src/libs/validations/productionStep.ts` file
- [ ] Add `productionStepExportParamsSchema` at the end of file
- [ ] Include search parameter validation (optional string, max 255 chars)
- [ ] Include sortBy parameter validation (createdAt, updatedAt, stepName, stepCode, filmSequence)
- [ ] Include sortOrder parameter validation (asc, desc)
- [ ] Add `ProductionStepExportParams` type export
- [ ] Add `validateProductionStepExportParams()` helper function
- [ ] Test validation with various parameter combinations
- [ ] Ensure validation follows same pattern as product export validation

## Step 3: Create Export API Endpoint
- [ ] Create directory `src/app/api/production-steps/export/`
- [ ] Create `src/app/api/production-steps/export/route.ts` file
- [ ] Copy structure from `src/app/api/products/export/route.ts`
- [ ] Import required dependencies (auth, NextRequest, ZodError, queries, validation)
- [ ] Implement GET handler with same auth pattern as products export
- [ ] Add query parameter extraction and validation
- [ ] Use `getPaginatedProductionSteps` with export parameters (limit: 5000)
- [ ] Add export data validation using new validation function
- [ ] Generate Excel file using new helper function
- [ ] Set proper response headers for Excel file download
- [ ] Implement same error handling patterns as products export
- [ ] Add proper filename generation (production-steps-export-timestamp.xlsx)
- [ ] Test API endpoint with various scenarios

## Step 4: Create Export Hook
- [ ] Create `src/hooks/useProductionStepExport.ts` file
- [ ] Copy structure from `src/hooks/useProductExport.ts`
- [ ] Define `ExportState` interface (isExporting, exportError, lastExportDate)
- [ ] Define `ExportReturn` interface with export function and state
- [ ] Implement `useProductionStepExport` hook following same pattern
- [ ] Add `exportProductionSteps()` function with proper parameter handling
- [ ] Build query parameters for API call (search, sortBy, sortOrder)
- [ ] Handle API response and file download trigger
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and state management
- [ ] Add `clearError()` function for error state reset
- [ ] Test hook functionality independently
- [ ] Verify file download behavior works correctly

## Step 5: Integrate Export Button in ProductionStepList
- [ ] Open `src/features/productionStep/ProductionStepList.tsx` file
- [ ] Import `Download` icon from `lucide-react`
- [ ] Import `useProductionStepExport` hook
- [ ] Add export hook to component state management
- [ ] Create `handleExport()` function that calls export with current filters
- [ ] Find header controls section (around line with search and sort controls)
- [ ] Add "Export to Excel" button with consistent styling
- [ ] Include loading state (show "Exporting..." when isExporting is true)
- [ ] Disable button during export operation
- [ ] Add export error display if needed
- [ ] Include error dismissal functionality
- [ ] Ensure button placement and styling matches existing UI patterns
- [ ] Test export button functionality

## Step 6: Create Export Type Definitions (Optional)
- [ ] Decide if separate types file is needed or extend existing types
- [ ] If creating new file: Create `src/types/productionStepExport.ts`
- [ ] Define `ProductionStepExportParams` interface (if not in validation file)
- [ ] Define `ProductionStepExportResult` interface if needed
- [ ] Ensure type compatibility with existing ProductionStep types
- [ ] Add proper exports and imports
