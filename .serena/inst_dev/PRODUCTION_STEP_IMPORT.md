# Production Step Import Feature Implementation

Implementation of Excel import functionality for production steps, adapting existing products import patterns for production step data management.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Step 1: Add production step import types to types/import.ts
- [x] Step 2: Create validation schema in libs/validations/productionStep.ts
- [x] Step 3: Add Excel helper functions to utils/excelImportHelpers.ts
- [x] Step 4: Create API route /api/production-steps/import/route.ts
- [x] Step 5: Implement React hook useProductionStepImport.ts
- [x] Step 11: Update middleware.ts to include new API route in protected routes

## In Progress Tasks

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Step 6: Create ProductionStepImportModal component
- [ ] Step 7: Integrate import modal into production steps page
- [ ] Step 8: Write unit tests for validation and helper functions
- [ ] Step 9: Write integration tests for API route
- [ ] Step 10: Write component tests for modal and hook
- [ ] Step 12: Test end-to-end import workflow
- [ ] Step 13: Update API documentation
- [ ] Step 14: Create user documentation for import feature

## Implementation Plan

### Architecture
- **Pattern**: Adapt existing products import functionality for production steps
- **Components**: Types, validation, Excel parsing, API route, React hook, modal component
- **Integration**: Add import button to production steps page with modal workflow
- **Authentication**: Use Clerk auth with owner-based data isolation

### Data Flow
1. User selects Excel file in modal
2. File uploaded to /api/production-steps/import endpoint
3. Server validates file format and parses Excel data
4. Each row validated against Zod schema
5. Production steps created in database with duplicate checking
6. Results returned with success/error counts and details
7. Modal displays results to user

### Technical Components
- **File Processing**: xlsx library for Excel parsing
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for data validation
- **API**: Next.js App Router with Clerk authentication
- **Frontend**: React hook + modal component pattern
- **Database**: Existing production step CRUD operations

### Key Features
- Excel template with required headers: Step Code, Step Name (required), Film Sequence, Step Group, Notes (optional)
- File validation (10MB limit, 1000 rows max)
- Duplicate checking within file and against existing database
- Detailed error reporting with row numbers
- Progress feedback and results display
